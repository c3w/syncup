syncup v0.1

This script requires a skeleton structure as follows
(pardon my ascii directory tree)
BACKUP_ROOT
          + [remote fully-qualified-host-name]
          |                                  + [rsync sharename]
          |                                  + [rsync sharename]
          |                                  + [rsync sharename]
          + [additional hosts, like above    ]
                                             + [rsync sharename]
                                             + [rsync sharename]

The upshot of this is that you only need to create a directory to add it
to the backup list.
